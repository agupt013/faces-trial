# FACES 2.0 (Trial Version)

FACES 2.0 is a face recognition application based on a method of machine learning known as a deep neural network. Funded by the Kress Foundation, it is designed to automatically test the degree of probability of a shared identification between different works of portrait art--that is, non-photographic portraits that are subject to the subjectivity of artistic interpretation. When used correctly with good images, it has the potential to match what is known with a given unknown--something that is unlikely to be accidental--and yields results that may be considered probable. In this, FACES has the potential to provide previously unnoticeable or unconfirmable information by contributing categories of quantifiable data for researchers to factor into their own analyses.
